### Converting string to camel case - 6 kyu

Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized.

### Examples

```jsx
toCamelCase("the-stealth-warrior") // returns "theStealthWarrior"

toCamelCase("The_Stealth_Warrior") // returns "TheStealthWarrior"
```
